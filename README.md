## ⚠️ Important legal & ethical notice

This repository contains a **sanitized write-up** of a phishing simulation performed **only** in a controlled, isolated lab environment using accounts and systems for which explicit permission was granted. It is intended for **educational** and **defensive** purposes only.

DO NOT use any of the techniques demonstrated against real users, organizations, or systems without explicit written authorization. Unauthorized phishing is illegal and unethical.
